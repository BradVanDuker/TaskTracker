The purpose of this mini project is to experiment with different ways for the code and db to interact.

Wanted Results:
1.  The code should not know anything about the underlying data storage.
2.  Be able to swap data storage with minimal changes to code

Things to try:
     * 1. Use something that will convert data to an object and vice versa
     * 2. Scrap ADO.NET and use something like Dapper.  Im' only using ADO for the practice.
     * 3. Try to incorporate  entity framework and linq (see web video)
     * 4. Switch databases to something more ADO friendly
     * 5. Convert all database fields to non-nullable
